# UK International keyboard layout with deadkeys
Made using the Microsoft keyboard layout creator, based on [this](http://zolid.com/uk-intl-kb/index.htm) if I remember correctly.
Tweaked to more closely match the standard layout on Linux systems.

PS: For anyone wondering, you may want to switch everything to US international. That's supported out of the box on many OSes...
